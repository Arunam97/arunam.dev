                        Hi! My name is <span id="nm">Arunam Gupta</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a <span id="jobs1">web developer</span>, <span id="jobs2">cyber-security engineer</span> and an <span id="is">international student</span> at the <span id="univ">University of Maryland, College Park</span>, majoring in
                        <span id="cs">Computer Science</span> and graduating in May 2022.
                    </p>
                    <p class="li1a">In addition to programming languages and technologies, my knowledge includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="li1">Mastery over algorithms: In any web application or software it is very important to do operations such as searching, sorting, and sometimes tree and graph traversals effectively so as to keep the cost of running the website low.
                            I have taken highest level of algorithms courses offered to undergraduate students at UMD. I also practice my algorithm design skills on LeetCode often. This means I am very good at designing efficient algorithms which do the
                            job with minimal resources and consequently, minimal cost.</li>
                        <li class="li1">Secure Code: Cybercrime will cost the world $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, and thus any application you deploy (especially on the internet) must be secure from outside threats. Because of my extensive experience in back-end programming
                            I know the best practices to make sure that the code I write is never part of any data breach or ransomware attacks.</li>
                        <li class="li1">
                            Reliability: I am reliable. The code I write is reliable. Any website that I design looks beautiful on any screen size, and retains its fluid and intuitive GUI across devices. I make sure that any product I work on is in continued operation with as little
                            downtime as possible. I create backups at regular intervals and use Git version control to work in teams with other people and keep track of any changes made.
                        </li>
