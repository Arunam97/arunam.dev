            <p>Hi! My name is Arunam Gupta.</p>
            <p>I am a Full-Stack Web Developer and a Cybersecurity Engineer.</p>
            <p>Welcome to my website.</p>

        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>I am an experienced web developer and an international student at the University of Maryland, College Park. Through hard work and daily studying I have acquired an exemplary understanding of computer networks, algorithms, bash scripting and database
            design. I can build both the front-end and the back-end of a website using the most common tech stacks and host them on the cloud. Moreover, I can make sure that the website is secure from all kinds of attacks. My diverse background in programming
            languages allows me to learn new technologies and languages at a much faster pace. My soft skills such as communication and teamwork are excellent and honed through years of working in group projects both as a leader and a member.</p>
        <h2>What are my strengths?</h2>
        <p><span id="mini-heading">Perseverance :</span> Once I set my eyes on a task I only stop when the work is done. I often lose track of time and keep working on the task at hand for hours and only get up when I feel like I have made good progress
            on it. <br>
            <span id="example">Example</span> : I never used to be a runner and was extremely lazy but one day I decided that I would run 5 km everyday. I got on the treadmill and started running at 10 km/hr and honestly felt like dying 1 minute in. I
            could barely breathe but I kept running and only took breaks after each kilometer was over. In about 45 minutes I had finished my 5 km. I wanted to stop so many times but I didn't. I got shin splints the next morning but that was ok because
            I achieved my goal. <br>The same goes when I am working on a technical project. When faced with a problem I go on StackOverflow to find a solution. If I cannot find a solution on StackOverflow I read the documentation. If I can't find a solution
            there then I write my own solution (thankfully this has never happened).
        </p>
        <p><span id="mini-heading">Humility :</span> Despite my hard work I know that I don't know everything. Thus I never shy away from asking questions when needed. In all my classes at the university I am always sitting in the front asking questions
            whenever I don't understand something. If someone asks me if I know something and I don't know it I say I don't know it rather than trying to guess the answer. I want to learn as much as I can and I cannot do that by pretending to possess
            knowledge that I do not.</p>
